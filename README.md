Pauling File Distinct Phases
==========

As known, the standard unit of the Pauling File (MPDS) data is an _entry_. All the entries are subdivided into three kinds: _crystalline structures_, _physical properties_, and _phase diagrams_. They are called _S_-, _P_- and _C_-entries, correspondingly. All these entries have persistent identifiers (similar to DOIs), e.g. [S377634](https://mpds.io/entry/S377634), [P600028](https://mpds.io/entry/P600028), or [C100027](https://mpds.io/entry/C100027).

These three kinds of entries are grouped together into the _distinct phases_ they belong. This term is often used in the alloys description, however here we apply it for all the compounds known from the scientific literature. A tremendous work was done by the Pauling File team in the past 30 years to manually distinguish about 200 000 inorganic materials phases, appeared at least once in the literature. Each phase has a unique combination of (a) chemical formula, (b) space group, and (c) Pearson symbol. Each phase has the permanent identifier called _phase_id_.

This repository contains the yearly releases of the Pauling File distinct phases for all the known _unary_ and _binary_ compounds. Please [contact us](https://mpds.io/products) if you are interested in the other compounds.
